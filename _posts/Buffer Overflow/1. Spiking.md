# 1. Spiking

By using this technique we can identify which command inside of application is vulnerable but before that lets just quicly connect to the service and see that it does and get a little familiar with it.

Here we can observe that we managed to connect to the service with "ncat" and use some commands that are provided by the application.

Right, so lets begin with spiking.

Before we start spiking we need to open the vulnserver in x32dbg, to do so run the debugger as Admin and after it is oppened we will click the folder icon (top left corener in debugger) to open the application.

After it is oppened in the debugger, press F9 (RUN) to make application run until the status is in Running state, this can be viewed on the bottom of debugger.

</p>

You will probably need to press F9 couple of times beacause the x32dbg pauses on System Breakpoints and INT3 entry point breakpoints.

Next to spike the commands in application we will use the "generic_send_tcp" tool on attacking machine, and we spike every command until the application crashes (in debugger the Runing state will change to Paused).

```bash
Usage: generic_send_tcp host port spike_script SKIPVAR SKIPSTR
```

before we execute this command we will need the "spike_script" and this is a simple 3 line script that will be used to fuzz commands.

```bash
# command.spk

s_readline();
s_string("STATS ");
s_string_variable("0");
```

this script will basically just read line and send command "STATS" with no variable so we can fuzz that command.

After this is done save it to a file called command.spk and after that this is how the final execution of "generic_send_tcp" command would look like for me.

```bash
 generic_send_tcp 192.168.56.104 9999 command.spk 0 0
```

SKIPVAR and SKIPSTR are set to 0 beacause we dont want to skip anything and want to make sure we are steadily and precisely spamming the command until the application crashes.

This is how the start of script looks like

</p>

Leave this running for around 1 minute or less, depends on the application how long input can it take.

After spiking for around 1 minute we can see in the debugger that application is still running meaning no buffer overflows are present on this specific command.

Beacause I already exploited this numerous times I know the vulnerable command is "TRUN" so lets spike again but instead of "STATS" command we put "TRUN" command in "command.spk" file.

After couple of seconds we can see how the applciation crashed (in Paused state). What all this means is that our input is not checked by the amount we can put inside of a "buffer" which is just a variable that stores our input and the function that puts our input into that variable does not check the size of our input which leads to our input overflowing the buffer and overwriting the EIP (instruction pointer) and since we overwrote it in this case our spiking script just puts all "A" characters as a Fuzzing example we will overwrite EIP with all A’s which is 41414141 in hexadecimal little endian format. Once the EIP sees this address which is non existent in appllication it will crash because it can’t go there.

</p>

This can be observed in Registers pane in debugger. We can see how EIP is overwritten with all A’s and EAX show the start of the command sent while ESP (stack pointer) also shows spiking script’s job :) all A’s.

Here is also a great picture I found by googleing to better show you what is a actually happening on the stack once we overflow everything on the stack with A’s.
