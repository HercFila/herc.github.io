# Hi 👋, I am Herc

Hacking is my hobby that I am very passionate about and can do it every day.  
I am a self taught Penetration Tester with around 3.5 years of experience in Cyber Security. 
   
Currently Working as Junior Penetration Tester, testing Web Applications for numerous vulnerabilities  
and exploits, also knowledgeable in many aspects like Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering which are  
my favourite parts of Cyber Security. Absolutely love improving and learning something new everday.  
  
Goal of my Blog is mainly to serve as a good resource to learn from and also  
kind of a reflection of my work that I can look back at anytime in my life.   

Favourite quote that keeps me alive:

```yaml
“Hard work is worthless for those that don’t believe in themselves.” – Naruto Uzumaki
```
