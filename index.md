Hi I am Herc,  

Hacking is my hobby and I am passionate about everything Cyber Security related.  
Would love to work in Cyber Security field which is the main reason why I am making this website to show of my work  
and of course for other poeple to learn from me things that maybe they didn't know before or improve something.  
Also I am not a wizard xD... obviously I don't know everything possible there is to know but my goal is to learn  
as much as possible from others and also to spread my knowledge and reasons why some thigs are done the way they are.  

Hope you will enjoy my posts and remember:
